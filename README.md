# EXAMPLES-MVS
This repo contains programs I have written with the ancient awesomeness available to us via IBM and MVS3.8j and contributors.

Inside is various programs written for fun to learn more about mainframes and the old-cool way of programming.
To use these files you can install Herculues emulator and MVS3.8j or use a tk4/5 distro. There are metric tons of youtube videos concerning this but I am in the process of creating a Wiki in order to showcase these working examples for our old stoof.
